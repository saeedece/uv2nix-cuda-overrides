My pyproject overrides for using PyTorch and JAX, which package their own CUDA binaries.

For use with [uv2nix](https://github.com/pyproject-nix/uv2nix).
Completely inspired and based off of [uv2nix_hammer_overrides](https://github.com/TyberiusPrime/uv2nix_hammer_overrides). Usage is also basically identical.

I will add overrides as I need them, even if they are not CUDA adjacent.
